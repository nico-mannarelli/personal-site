      <p>
        I'm a computer science and math student at the University of Maryland. I'm passionate about systems programming, building software 
        quantum computing, machine learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy building performant systems, exploring the intersection of quantum computing 
        and ML, and working on challenging technical problems that push the boundaries of 
        what's possible. [TEST EDIT - This should appear if hot reload is working]

      <p>
        My work focuses on creating efficient, secure solutions for complex problems in 
        systems programming, quantum algorithms, and defense applications.
