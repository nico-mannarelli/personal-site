Implementation of a hybrid cryptographic protocol combining classical and post-quantum algorithms:

- Lattice-based key exchange (Kyber)
- Digital signatures with forward secrecy
- Zero-knowledge proof integration
- Performance benchmarks and security analysis

Designed for defense applications requiring long-term security guarantees against quantum adversaries.
