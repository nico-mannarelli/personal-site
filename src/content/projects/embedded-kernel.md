A minimal real-time kernel for resource-constrained embedded devices. Key features:

- Deterministic task scheduling with priority-based preemption
- Memory protection and isolation
- Inter-process communication primitives
- Hardware abstraction layer for portability

Optimized for applications requiring predictable timing guarantees and low-latency response.
